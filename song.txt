Fall Apart

[Verse 1]
I know I knew it all along
That you and I were wrong
Convincing myself it wasn't true
That I was meant for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm pissed at myself
Distraught in my own thought
Even though I love you
I need a love that's true

[Chorus]
In my heart of hearts
I, I knew it'd fall apart
I

[Verse 2]
Now it's becoming clear
What I have to do from here
Distance myself away from you
And everything we knew

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm pissed at myself
Distraught in my own thought
Even though I love you
I need a love that's true

[Chorus]
In my heart of hearts
I, I knew it'd fall apart
I
It was broken from the start
I, I knew it'd fall apart
I

In my heart of hearts
I, I knew it'd fall apart
I
It was broken from the start
I, I knew it'd fall apart
I
